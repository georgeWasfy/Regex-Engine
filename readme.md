# Regex Engine Exploration Notebook

## Overview

This repository contains a single Jupyter Notebook, `regex_engine.ipynb`, designed to explore the inner workings of regular expression engines. The notebook provides hands-on examples, visualizations, and explanations to demystify how regex engines process patterns and match text.


## Content of the Notebook

The `regex_engine.ipynb` notebook covers the following topics:

*   **Introduction to Regular Expressions:** A brief overview of regex syntax and basic concepts.
*   **Finite Automata:** A description of how regular expression can be expressed as DFAs and NFAs
*   **Thompson's Construction:** Step-by-step explanation of Thompson's Construction to turn regex into NFA.
*   **NFA Simulation:** Simulate NFA to understand their behavior.
